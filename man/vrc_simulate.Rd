\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{df_full}: full long-format dataset (may contain \code{NA} in \code{y}).
\item \code{df_obs}: subset of rows with observed \code{y}.
\item \code{truth}: latent arrays and parameters used for simulation.
\item \code{meta}: dimension metadata.
}
}
\description{
Simulate a long-format vital registration (VR) dataset with a latent
mortality process and an explicit observation (reporting) process that can
collapse after a conflict start time.

The simulator generates:
\itemize{
\item latent cause-specific mortality rates (by region, time, age, sex),
\item true deaths given population denominators,
\item observed VR counts given cause- and age-specific reporting completeness,
\item optional misclassification between trauma and non-trauma,
\item optional additional missingness mechanisms to stress test inference.
}
}
\details{
The \code{missing} argument allows additional missingness beyond the reporting
process. This is useful for stress testing identifiability.

Supported patterns:
\itemize{
\item \code{type = "none"}: no additional missingness.
\item \code{type = "block"}: region-time block dropout.
\item \code{type = "age_selective"}: older-age dropout (typically for non-trauma).
\item \code{type = "mnar"}: missing-not-at-random dropout driven by true death burden.
\item \code{type = "combined"}: apply all three.
}

If \code{missing$missing_to_zero = TRUE}, missing cells are converted to zeros
(tests robustness to bad pipelines). Otherwise missing values become \code{NA}.
