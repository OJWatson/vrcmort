\title{vrcmort: Vital registration mortality models with reporting processes}
\description{
The \code{vrcmort} package provides tools for fitting hierarchical Bayesian models
to cause-specific vital registration (VR) mortality counts when the VR
reporting mechanism changes over time (for example, during armed conflict).
The core model separates a latent mortality process from an observation
(reporting) process, allowing conflict to increase true mortality while
observed non-trauma VR counts can decline because reporting collapses.

The package also includes a simulator with multiple missingness mechanisms
for stress testing inference.
