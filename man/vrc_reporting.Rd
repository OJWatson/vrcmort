\usage{
vrc_reporting(
  formula = ~1,
  conflict = c("fixed", "region"),
  time = c("national", "region")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model formula. The default \code{~ 1} specifies no additional
covariates.}

\item{conflict}{How to model the conflict effect in the reporting component.
Use \code{"fixed"} for one effect shared across regions (per cause), or
\code{"region"} for partial pooling (random slopes) by region (per cause).}

\item{time}{How to model time variation in the reporting component.
\code{"national"} uses a single random walk shared across regions (per cause).
\code{"region"} adds region-specific random walk deviations around the national
trend.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vrc_reporting}.
}
\description{
Create a reporting component specification for \code{\link[=vrcm]{vrcm()}}. This is a light
wrapper around a formula describing additional reporting covariates (beyond
the always-included conflict proxy).

The formula should not include \code{conflict}; conflict is included in the core
Stan model as \code{gamma_conf}.
