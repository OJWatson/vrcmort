Description: Tools for fitting hierarchical Bayesian models to cause-specific
    vital registration (VR) mortality counts in settings where the VR reporting
    mechanism changes over time (for example, during armed conflict). The core
    model separates a latent mortality process from an observation (reporting)
    process, allowing conflict to simultaneously increase true mortality while
    reducing registration completeness in a cause- and age-selective way. The
    package includes a realistic simulator with multiple missingness mechanisms
    for stress-testing inference.
