title: vrcmort
---

`vrcmort` provides tools for fitting hierarchical Bayesian models to vital registration mortality when reporting completeness changes over time (for example during armed conflict).

The package is organised around a two-layer model:

- a latent mortality process (true deaths), and
- a reporting process (registration completeness, including age-selective collapse).

## Where to start

- Read **Model Introduction** for the quickest orientation.
- Then move to **Model Description** for the mathematics.
- Use the tutorials to prepare VR long data from individual records and to run common modelling workflows.
